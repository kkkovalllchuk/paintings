                         <p class="InfoPage2__mainText" >Paul Delvaux shows a great interest in classical antiquity, especially Greece and Rome, and depicts the central woman as a muse or goddess, an inspiring, beautiful, but inaccessible to human touch woman. It is noteworthy that the composition shows both modern and classical elements, presenting a timeless look, a technique that Delvaux often used in his paintings. Considered by some to be a surrealist, Delvaux has said that he does not support the theories of Sigmund Freud and does not include psychoanalytic references in his paintings. In 2016, "The Road to Rome" was sold by Sotheby's to a private collector for $2.6 million.

                         <p class="InfoPage2__mainText" >Lucien Freud, born in Berlin, Germany, grandson of psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, spent most of his life in London, England, where he joined the London School, a group of figurative artists that included Francis Bacon, R. B. China, Frank Auerbach, and Leon Kossoff, among others. The painting Girl with a Kitten depicts one of Lucien Freud's wives, the artist Kitty Harman. This composition shows similarities to early Dutch paintings of the fifteenth century. Surprisingly, Lucien Freud could have fathered 40 children, but only 14 of them have been identified.</p>

Xiaodong paints in the style of Socialist Realism and is strongly influenced by the figurative paintings of Lucien Freud. He often paints lao bai xing, ordinary people, in everyday poses and situations. The four ordinary people in Time mostly ignore the young man lying on the ground, on the sidelines, unconscious or dead. Why don't they investigate and find out if this person needs help? Maybe they don't want to get involved. Is this a message about life in modern China?</p>

                         <p class="InfoPage2__mainText" >Camille Pissarro was a pioneer of French Impressionism and Neo-Impressionism; in fact, he was the only artist to exhibit his work at all the Paris Impressionist exhibitions from 1874 to 1886. Moreover, he was the father of such great Impressionists as Georges Seurat, Paul Cézanne, Vincent Van Gogh, and Paul Gauguin. The art historian John Reward called him "the dean of the Impressionist painters" because he was the oldest in the group and had a pleasant and affable personality. "Harvesting Hay in Erania demonstrates Pissarro's penchant for painting rural people performing simple tasks. In 1882, Pierre Auguste Renior called Pissarro's work "revolutionary" at the time. Hay Harvest emphasizes Pissarro's interest in Neo-Impressionism, especially his use of pointillism; in fact, he was the only Impressionist painter to eventually switch to Neo-Impressionism.</p>

                         <p class="InfoPage2__mainText" > Cassius Coolidge was born in Antwerp, New York. His parents were Quaker abolitionists. Coolidge, who disliked agricultural labor, left the fields in the 1860s and began to earn a living by painting signs, illustrating books, and creating cartoons for newspapers. Although Coolidge had little artistic training, he was well educated. Then, while working at carnivals, he created new life-size portraits with comedic elements that became known as front comic plans. The Poker Game is one of 16 in a series of calendar paintings created by Coolidge in the early 1900s. All of these works depict anthropomorphized dogs engaged in human activities, such as playing poker. Coolidge is credited with creating this motif, which he also used to depict dogs playing billiards. It is noteworthy that in 2015, Poker Game was sold for $658,000.</p>
